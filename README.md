# Actions spike
Spike with the purpose of running Github Actions. We have:
* Created a repo contained a sample app using this as a base https://github.com/softwareyoga/docker-tomcat-tutorial.git
* Extracted codebase from war file on the sample app so that we can build it as part of the image itself
* Modified the Dockerfile to build the war file a layer instea.
